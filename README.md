# Automatic-Fish-Feeder

This Arduino Code runs an Automatic Fish Feeder code.

Good Day!

This program (Charlie) was developed by Emmanuel Ogunjirin. At the time, as a current student of University of Virginia, 
I developed this arduino code to be used by any individual. This code allows you at the launch of the a "Charlie.ino" file to 
launch a arduino window to automatically control a servo motor rotating at specified time interval to feed a fish. Additionally, 
the code also allows you to display the countdown timer to the next feeding time as determined by the user. 

The script come free of charge, and free to use as is. The script that comes as is and at no time is the developer, Emmanuel 
Ogunjirin, responsible for any type of damage that is inflicted as a result of utilizing this script. A fully commented ".ino" 
file is available for you to edit and export as you wish.

Have a nice day :-)
